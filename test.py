#I am trying to figure out what these things are.  Some of them are variables?  Some are functions?  I will look at the 
3-4 day python bootcamp sylabus and the 12 week bootcamp sylybus to break this down into chunks and see
what I am actually learning.  

x = 1 

y = 2

z = x + y 

# print x, y, z


for i in range(0,3): # range(0,3) looks like [0,1,2]
	print( i ) 

if( z > 0 ):
	print( z )
else:
	print( 0 )

while( z > 0 ):
	z = z - 1 



def print_x_3_times( x ):
	for i in range(3):
		print( x )



print_x_3_times( "hi " )
